When we reached the Prophet, we did not find him in his house. We found there Aisha, the Mother of the Believers. She ordered that a dish called Khazirah should be prepared for us. It was then prepared. A tray containing dates was then presented to us. (The narrator Qutaybah did not mention the word qina', tray). \n\n\n\nThen the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came. He asked: Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?  We replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting in the company of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) we suddenly saw that a shepherd was driving a herd of sheep to their fold. He had with him a newly-born lamb that was crying. \n\n\n\nHe (the Prophet) asked him: What did it bear, O so and so? He replied: A ewe. He then said: Slaughter for us in its place a sheep. Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred sheep and we do not want their number to increase. Whenever a ewe is born, we slaughter a sheep in its place. \n\n\n\n(The narrator says that the Prophet (\ufdfa) used the word la tahsabanna, do not think). \n\n\n\nI (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He said: Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company with me and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey you). If there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and do not beat your wife as you beat your slave-girl. \n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about ablution.

Later on he transmitted it to us from his memory: Muhammad b. 'Amr reported to us from al-Zuhri from 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah who said: Fatimah used to have her blood flowing. He then reported the tradition conveying the same meaning.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Anas b. Sirin reported from Ibn 'Abbas about the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood. He said: If she sees thick blood, she should not pray; if she finds herself purified even for a moment, she should was an pray.\n\n\nMakhul said: Menses are not hidden from women. Their blood is black and thick. When it (blackness and thickness) goes away and there appears yellowness and liquidness, that is the flow of blood (from vein). She should wash and pray.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Sa'id b. al-Musayyab through a different chain of narrators, saying: The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer when the menstruation begins; when it is finished, she should wash and pray.\n\n\nSumayy and others have also reported it from Sa'id b. al-Musayyab. This version adds: She should refrain (from prayer) during her menstrual period.\n\n\nHammad b. Salamah has reported it similarly from Yahya b. Sa'id on the authority of Sa'id b. al-Musayyab.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Yunus has reported from Al-Hasan: When the bleeding of a menstruating woman extends (beyond the normal period), she should refrain (from prayer), after her menses are over, for one or two days. Now she becomes the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood.\n\n\nAl-Taimi reported from Qatadah: If her menstrual period is prolonged by five days, she should pray. Al-Taimi said: I kept on reducing (the number of days) until I reached two days. He said: If the period extends by two days, they will be counted from the menstrual period. When Ibn Sirin was questioned about it, he said: Women have better knowledge of that.\n",

I found him in the house of my sister, Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh.  \n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting.  \n\n\n\nHe said: I suggest that you should use cotton, for it absorbs the blood.  She replied: It is too copious for that.  He said: Then take a cloth.  She replied: It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps flowing.  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: I shall give you two commands; whichever of them you follow, that will be sufficient for you without the other, but you know best whether you are strong enough to follow both of them.  \n\n\n\nHe added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification.  \n\n\n\nBut if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so: and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible.\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Of the two commands this is more to my liking.1\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: 'Amr b.

I inform you how the bath (on Friday) commenced. The people were poor and used to wear woolen clothes, and would carry loads on their backs. Their mosque was small and its rood was lowered down. It was a sort of trellis of vine. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) once came out on a hot day and the people perspired profusely in the woolen clothes so much so that foul smell emitted from them and it caused trouble to each other. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) found the foul smell, he said: O people, when this day (Friday) comes, you should take bath and every one should anoint the best oil and perfume one has. Ibn 'Abbas then said: Then Allah, the Exalted, provided wealth (to the people) and they wore clothes other than the woolen, and were spared from work, and their mosque became vast. The foul smell that caused trouble to them became non-existent.",

            "hadith_english": "Prayer passed through three stages. And out people narrated to us that Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; it is to my liking that the prayer of Muslims or believers should be united (i.e., in congregation), so much so that I intended to send people to the houses to announce the time of prayer; and I also resolved that I should order people to stand at (the tops of) the forts and announce the time of the prayer for Muslims; and they struck the bell or were about to strike the bell (to announce the time for prayer). Then came a person from among the Ansar who said: Messenger of Allah, when I returned from you, as I saw your anxiety. I saw (in sleep) a person with two green clothes on him; he stood on the  mosque and called (people) to prayer. He then sat down for a short while and stood up and pronounced in a like manner, except that he added: \u201cThe time for prayer has come\u201d. If the people did not call me (a liar), and according to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, if you did not call me (a liar). I would say that I was awake; I was awake; I was not asleep. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: According to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, Allah has shown you a good (dream). But the version of \u2018Amr does not have the words: Allah has shown you a good (dream). Then ask Bilal to pronounce the ADHAN (to call to the prayer). \u2018Umar (in the meantime) said: I also had a dream like the one he had. But as he informed earlier. I was ashamed (to inform). Our people have narrated to us: when a person came (to the mosque during the prayer in congregation), he would ask (about the RAKAHS of prayer), and he would be informed about the number of RAKAHS already performed. They would stand (in prayer) along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him): some in standing position; others bowing; some sitting and some praying along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).\n\n\nIbn al-Muthanna reported from \u2018Amr from Hussain b. Abi Laila, saying ; Until Mu\u2019adh came. Shu\u2019bah said ; I heard it from Hussain who said : I shall follow the position (in the prayer in which I find him (the prophet)). . . you should do in a similar way.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: I then turned to the tradition reported by \u2018Amr b. Marzuq he said; then Ma\u2019adh came and they (the people) hinted at him. Shu\u2019bah said; I heard it from hussain who said: Mu\u2019adh then said; I shall follow the position (in the prayer when I join it) in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: Mu\u2019adh has prayer when I join it in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: MU\u2019adh has introduced for you a SUNNAH (a model behaviour), so you should do in a like manner.\nHe said; our people have narrated to us; when the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came to Madina, he commanded them (the people) to keep fast  for three days. Thereafter the Quranic verses with regard to the fasts during Ramadan were revealed. But they were people who were not accustomed to keep fast ; hence the keeping of the fasts was hard for them; so those who could not keep fast would feed an indigent; then the month\u201d. The concession was granted to the patient and the traveler; all were commanded to keep fast.\n",

The narrator, Ibn al-Muthanna, narrated the story of saying prayer facing in the direction of Jerusalem.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The third stage is that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came to Medina and prayed, i.e. facing Jerusalem, for thirteen months.  \n\n\n\nThen Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: \"We have seen thee turning thy face to Heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wherever ye may be, turn your face (when ye pray) toward it\" (ii.144). And Allah, the Reverend and the Majestic, turned (them) towards the Ka'bah. He (the narrator) completed his tradition.  \n\n\n\nThe narrator, Nasr, mentioned the name of the person who had the dream, saying: And Abdullah ibn Zayd, a man from the Ansar, came. The same version reads: And he turned his face towards the qiblah and said: Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer (he pronounced it twice), come to salvation (he pronounced it twice); Allah is Most Great, Allah is most great. He then paused for a while, and then got up and pronounced in a similar way, except that after the phrase \"Come to salvation\" he added. \"The time for prayer has come, the time for prayer has come.\"  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Teach it to Bilal, then pronounce the adhan (call to prayer) with the same words. As regards fasting, he said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth of Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: \".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84). If someone wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day; it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted, revealed: \"The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an ..........(let him fast the same) number of other days\" (ii.185).  \n\n\n\nHence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the month (of Ramadan) and the traveller was required to atone (for them); feeding (the indigent) was prescribed for the old man and woman who were unable to fast. (The narrator, Nasr, further reported): The companion Sirmah, came after finishing his day's work......and he narrated the rest of the tradition.\n",

I met a group of the Companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa). They said: Six persons of us intended to do so (i.e. divorce their wives and purchase weapons), but the Prophet (\ufdfa) prohibited them. He said: For you in the Messenger of Allah there is an excellent model. I then came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the witr observed by the Prophet (\ufdfa). He said: I point to you a person who is most familiar with the witr observed by the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Go to 'Aishah. While going to her I asked Hakim b. Aflah to accompany me. He refused, but I adjured him. He, therefore, went along with me. We sought permission to enter upon 'Aishah. She said: Who is this ? He said: Hakim b. Aflah. She asked: Who is with you ? He replied: Sa'd b. Hisham. She said: Hisham son of 'Amir who was killed in the Battle of  Uhud. I said: Yes. She said: What a good man 'Amir was! I said: Mother of faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). She asked: Do you not recite the Quran ? The character of Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was the Qur'an. I asked: Tell me about his vigil and prayer at night. She replied: Do you not recite: \"O thou folded in garments\" (73:1). I said: Why not ?\n\n\nWhen the opening of this Surah was revealed, the Companions stood praying (most of the night) until their fett swelled, and the concluding verses were not revealed for twelve months from heaven. At last the concluding verses were revealed and the prayer at night became voluntary after it was obligatory. I said: Tell me about the witr of the Prophet (\ufdfa). She replied: He used to pray eight rak'ahs, sitting only during the eighth of them. Then he would stand up and pray another rak'ahs. He would sit only after the eighth and the ninth rak'ahs. He would utter salutation only after the ninth rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son. But when he grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, sitting only in sixth and seventh rak'ahs, and would utter salutation only after the seventh rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting, and that made nine rak'ahs, O my son. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) would not pray through a whole night, or recite the whole Qur'an in a night or fast a complete month except in Ramadan. When he offered prayer, he would do that regularly. When he was overtaken by sleep at night, he would pray twelve rak'ahs.\n\n\nThe narrator said: I came to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated all this to him. By Allah, this is really a tradition. Has I been on speaking terms with her, I would have come to her and heard it from her mouth. I said: If I knew that you were not on speaking terms with her, I would have never narrated it to you.\n",

He presumed that Abu Bakr had written it for Anas when he sent him (to Al Bahrain) as a collector of zakat. This (letter) was stamped with the stamp of the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) and was written by Abu Bakr for him(Anas). This letter goes \u201cThis is the obligatory sadaqah(zakat) which the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) imposed on Muslims which Allah commanded his Prophet(\ufdfa) to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For less than twenty five Camels a goat is to be given for every five Camels. When they reach twenty five to thirty five, a she Camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she Camel in her second year, a male Camel in its third year is to be given. When they reach thirty six to forty five, a she Camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty six to sixty , a she Camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty one to seventy five, a she Camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy six to ninety, two she Camel in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety one to a hundred and twenty, two she Camels in their fourth year are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she Camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she Camel in her fourth year for every fifty(Camels). In case the ages of the Camel vary in the payment of obligatory sadaqah(zakat) If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possess one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him.\u201d\n\n\nAbu Dawud said From here I could not retain accurately from Musa as I liked \u201cAnd he must give along with it two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable possesses only one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him.\u201d \nAbu Dawud said (I was doubtful) up to here, and retained correctly onward \u201cand the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, but he must give two goats or twenty dirhams. Anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses a male Camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him, and nothing extra will be demanded along with it. If anyone possesses only four Camels, no zakat will be payable on them unless their owner wishes. If the numbers of the pasturing goats reach forty to one hundred and twenty, one goat is to be given. Over one hundred and twenty up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed two hundred reaching three hundred, three goats are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a goat is to be for every hundred. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat) unless the collector wishes. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqah(zakat). Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity, If a man\u2019s pasturing animals are less than forty, no sadaqah(zakat) is due on them unless their owner wishes.

Two people riding a camel came to me.  \n\n\n\nThey said to me: We are messengers of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), sent to you so that you may pay the sadaqah (zakat) on your sheep.  \n\n\n\nI asked: What is due from me for them?  \n\n\n\nThey said: One goat. I went to a goat which I knew was full of milk and fat, and I brought it to them.  \n\n\n\nThey said: This is a pregnant goat. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) prohibited us to accept a pregnant goat.  \n\n\n\nI asked: What will you take then?  They said: A goat in its second year or a goat in its third year. I then went to a goat which had not given birth to any kid, but it was going to do so. I brought it to them.  \n\n\n\nThey said: Give it to us. They took it on the camel and went away.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Abu 'Asim transmitted this tradition from Zakariyya. He said: Muslim bin Shu'bah is a narrator in the chain of this tradition as reported by the narrator Rawh.\n",

Here is another she-camel which is young, grand and fat. So take it.  \n\n\n\nI said to him: I shall not take an animal for which I have not been commanded. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) is here near to you. If you like, go to him, and present to him what you presented to me. Do that; if he accepts it from you, I shall accept it; if he rejects it, I shall reject it.  \n\n\n\nHe said: I shall do it. He accompanied me and took with him the she-camel which he had presented to me. We came to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). He said to him: Prophet of Allah, your messenger came to me to collect zakat on my property. By Allah, neither the Messenger of Allah nor his messenger has ever seen my property before. I gathered my property (camels), and he estimated that a she-camel in her second year would be payable by me. But that has neither milk nor is it worth riding. So I presented to him a grand young she-camel for acceptance as  zakat. But he has refused to take her. Look, she is here; I have brought her to you, Messenger of Allah. Take her.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: That is what is due from you. If you give voluntarily a better (animal) Allah will give a reward to you for it. We accept her from you.  \n\n\n\nShe is here, Messenger of Allah; I have brought her to you. So take her.

Aqra' took his document, wrapped it in his turban, and went away.  \n\n\n\nAs for Uyaynah, he took his document and came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) at his home, and said to him: Muhammad, do you see me? I am taking a document to my people, but I do not know what it contains, just like the document of al-Mutalammis. Mu'awiyah informed the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) of his statement.  \n\n\n\nThereupon the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: He who begs (from people) when he has sufficient is simply asking for a large amount of Hell-fire. (An-Nufayl (a transmitter) said elsewhere: \"embers of Hell\".)  \n\n\n\nThey asked: Messenger of Allah, what is a sufficiency? (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: What is a sufficiency which makes begging unfitting?)  \n\n\n\nHe replied: It is that which would provide a morning and an evening meal. (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: It is when one has enough for a day and night, or for a night and a day.) He (an-Nufayl) narrated to us this tradition briefly in the words that I have mentioned.\n",

The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) performed only one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came out (from Medina) with the intention of performing hajj. When he offered two rak'ahs of prayer in the mosque at Dhul-Hulayfah, he made it obligatory by wearing it.  \n\n\n\nAt the same meeting, he raised his voice in the talbiyah for hajj, when he finished his two rak'ahs. Some people heard it and I retained it from him. He then rode (on the she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they thought that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) proceeded further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment. They thought that he had raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'. I swear by Allah, he raised his voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'.  \n\n\n\nSa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah (and ihram) at the place of is prayer after he finishes two rak'ahs of his prayer.\n",

But according to the version of Hammad bin Salamah, he said as for myself, I shall raise my voice in talbiyah for Hajj because I have sacrificial animal with me.

The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) entered upon me while I was weeping.  He asked why are you weeping?  I wished I would not come out (for Hajj) this year.  He said give up your `Umrah; untie your hair and comb.  The version of Musa said and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram).  Sulaiman\u2019s version goes and do as all the Muslims do during their Hajj.  When the night for performing the obligatory circumambulation (tawaf al-Ziyarah) came, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded `Abd al-Rahman.

            "hadith_english": "Ja\u2019far bin Muhammad reported on the authority of his father \u201cWe entered upon Jabir bin \u2018Abd Allaah. When we reached him, he asked about the people (who had come to visit him). When my turn came I said \u201cI am Muhammad bin Ali bin Hussain. He patted my head with his hand and undid my upper then lower buttons. He then placed his hand between my nipples and in those days I was a young boy.\u201d He then said \u201cwelcome to you my nephew, ask what you like. I questioned him he was blind. The time of prayer came and he stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulders its ends fell due to its shortness. He led us in prayer while his mantle was placed on a rack by his side. I said \u201ctell me about the Hajj of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa).\u201dHe signed with his hand and folded his fingers indicating nine.  He then said Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) remained nine years (at Madeenah ) during which he did not perform Hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) was about to (go to) perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Madeenah everyone desiring to follow him and act like him. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went out and we too went out with him till we reached Dhu Al Hulaifah. Asma\u2019 daughter of \u2018Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. She sent message to Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) asking him What should I do?He replied \u201ctake a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth and put on ihram.\u201d The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then prayed (in the masjid) and mounted Al Qaswa\u2019 and his she Camel stood erect with him on its back. Jabir said \u201cI saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him and a similar number on his right side and a similar number on his left side and a similar number behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) was among us, the Qur\u2019an was being revealed to him and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then raised his voice declaring Allaah\u2019s unity and saying \u201cLabbaik ( I am at thy service), O Allaah, labbaik, labbaik, Thou hast no partner praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. Thou hast no partner. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah which they used to utter. But the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) did not forbid them anything. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) continued his talbiyah. Jabir said \u201cWe did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of \u2018Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka\u2019bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits) walking quickly with pride in three of them and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham he recited \u201cAnd take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.\u201d (While praying two rak\u2019ahs) he kept the station between him and the House. The narrator said My father said that Ibn Nufail and \u2018Uthman said I do not know that he (Jabir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (\ufdfa). The narrator Sulaiman said I do not know but he (Jabir) said \u201cThe Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) used to recite in the two rak\u2019ahs \u201cSay, He is Allaah, one\u201d and \u201cSay O infidels\u201d. He then returned to the House (the ka\u2019bah) and touched the corner after which he went out by the gate to Al Safa\u2019. When he reached near Al Safa\u2019 he recited \u201cAl Safa\u2019 and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah\u201d and he added \u201cWe begin with what Allaah began with\u201d. He then began with Al Safa\u2019 and mounting it till he could see the House (the Ka\u2019bah) he declared the greatness of Allaah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said \u201cthere is no god but Allaah alone, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates. He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al Marwah and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached Al Marwah. He did at al Marwah as he had done at Al Safa\u2019 and when he came to Al Marwah for the last time, he said \u201cIf I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an \u2018Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may take off ihram and treat it as an \u2018Umrah. All the people then took off ihram and clipped their hair except the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Suraqah (bin Malik) bin Ju\u2019sham then got up and asked Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa)does this apply to the present year or does it apply for ever? The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) interwined his fingers and said \u201cThe \u2018Umarh has been incorporated in Hajj. Adding \u2018No\u2019, but forever and ever. \u2018Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) and found Fathima among one of those who had taken off their ihram. She said put on colored clothes and stained her eyes with collyrium. \u2018Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked Who commanded you for this? She said \u201cMy father\u201d. Jabir said \u2018Ali said at Iraq I went to Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) to complain against Fathima for what she had done and to ask the opinion of Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) about which she mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me \u201cMy father commanded me to do this.\u201d He said \u201cShe spoke the truth, she spoke the truth.\u201d What did you say when you put on ihram for Hajj? I said O Allaah, I put on ihram for the same purpose for which Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) has put it on. He said I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off ihram. He (Jabir) said \u201cThe total of those sacrificial animals brought by \u2018Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (\ufdfa) from Madeenah was one hundred.\u201d Then all the people except the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had with them the sacrificial animals took off ihram and clipped their hair. When the 8th of Dhu Al Hijjah (Yaum Al Tarwiyah) came, they went towards Mina having pit on ihram for Hajj and the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) rode and prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namrah. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then sent out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at Al Mash \u2018ar Al Haram at Al Muzdalifah, as the Quraish used to do in the pre Islamic period but he passed on till he came to \u2018Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namrah. There he dismounted and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered Al Qaswa\u2019 to be brought and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people saying \u201cYour lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in the month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre Islamic period has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours (according to the version of the narrator \u2018Uthman, the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi\u2019ah and according to the version of the narrator Sulaiman the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi\u2019ah bin Al Harith bin \u2018Abd Al Muttalib). Some (scholars) said \u201che was suckled among Banu Sa\u2019d(i.e., he was brought up among Bani Sa\u2019d) and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre Islamic period is abolished and the first of usury I abolish is our usury, the usury of \u2018Abbas bin \u2018Abd Al Muttalib for it is all abolished. Fear Allaah regarding women for you have got them under Allah\u2019s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allaah\u2019s word. It is a duty from you on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds but if they do beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something by which if you hold to it you will never again go astray, that is Allaah\u2019s Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say? They replied \u201cWe testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said \u201cO Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness! Bilal then uttered the call to prayer and the iqamah and he prayed the noon prayer, he then uttered the iqamah and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted (his she Camel) al Qaswa\u2019 and came to the place of standing , making his she Camel Al Qaswa\u2018 turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him and he faced the qiblah. He remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usamah up behind him and picked the reins of Al Qaswa\u2019 severely so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with is right hand he was saying \u201cCalmness, O People! Calmness, O people. Whenever he came over a mound (of sand) he let loose its reins a little so that it could ascend. He then came to Al Muzdalifah where he combined the sunset and night prayers, with one adhan and two iqamahs. The narrator \u2018Uthamn said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer when the morning light was clear. The narrator Sulaiman said with one adhan and one iqamah. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then mounted Al Qaswa\u2019 and came to Al Mash\u2019ar Al Haram and ascended it. The narrators \u2018Uthaman and Sulaiman said He faced the qiblah praised Allaah, declared His greatness, His uniqueness. \u2018Uthamn added in his version and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then went quickly before the sun rose , taking Al Fadl bin \u2018Abbas behind him. He was a man having beautiful hair, white and handsome color. When the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went quickly, the women in the howdas also began to pass him quickly. Al Fadl began to look at them. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) placed his hand on the face of Al Fadl , but Al fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al Fadl also turned his face to the other side looking at them till he came to (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the Camel a little and following a middle road which comes out at the greatest jamrah, he came to the jamrah which is beside the tree and he threw seven small pebbles at this (jamrah) saying \u201cAllah is most great\u201d each time he threw a pebble like bean seeds. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then went to the place of the sacrifice  and sacrificed sixty three Camels with his own hand. He then commanded \u2018Ali who sacrificed the remainder and he shared him and his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each Camel should be put in a pot and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. The narrator Sulaiman said the he mounted afterwards the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went quickly to the House (the Ka\u2019bah) and prayed the noon prayer at Makkah. He came to Banu \u2018Abd Al Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said draw water Banu \u2018Abd Al Muttalib were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you. So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.",

And if ye know not their fathers, then (they are) your brethren in the faith and your clients. They were then called by their names of their fathers. A man, whose father was not known, remained under the protection of someone and considered brother in faith. Sahlah daughter of Suhail bin Amr Al Quraishi then came and said Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa), we used to consider Salim(our) son. He dwelled with me and Abu Hudhaifah in the same house, and he saw me in the short clothes, but Allaah the Exalted, has revealed about them what you know, then what is your opinion about him? The Prophet (\ufdfa) said give him your breast feed. She gave him five breast feeds. He then became like her foster son. Hence, A\u2019ishah(may Allaah be pleased with her) used to ask the daughters of her sisters and the daughters of her brethren to give him breast feed five times, whom A\u2019ishah wanted to see and who wanted to visit her. Though he might be of age; he then visited her. But Umm Salamah and all other wives of the Prophet (\ufdfa) refused to allow anyone to visit them on the basis of such breast feeding unless one was given breast feed during infancy.

They (i.e., the guardians) were prohibited to marry them except that they do justice to them and pay them their maximum customary dower and they were asked to marry women other than them (i.e., the orphans) who seem good to them. \u2018Urwah reported that A\u2019ishah said \u201cThe people then consulted the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) about women after revelation of this verse. Thereupon Allaah the Exalted sent down the verse \u201cThey consult thee concerning  women. Say Allaah giveth you decree concerning them and the scripture which hath been recited unto you(giveth decree) concerning female orphans unto whom you give not that which is ordained for them though  you desire to marry them. \u201c She said \u201cThe mention made by Allaah about the Scripture recited to them refers to the former verse in which Allaah has said \u201cAnd if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you.\u201d A\u2019ishah said \u201cThe pronouncement of Allaah , the Exalted in the latter verse \u201cthough you desire to marry them\u201d means the disinterest of one of you in marrying a female orphan who was under his protection, but she said little property and beauty. So they were prohibited to marry them for their interest in the property and beauty of the female orphans due to their disinterest in themselves except that they do justice )to them). The narrator Yunus said \u201cRabi\u2019ah said explain the Qur\u2019anic verse \u201cAnd if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans\u201d means \u201cLeave them if you fear (that you will not do justice to them), for I have made four women lawful for you.\u201d",

One part of the expedition to al-Hudaybiyyah had a share in Khaybar.  \n\n\n\nWhen he was nearing his death, he said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) married me to so-and-so, and I did not fix a dower for her, nor did I give anything to her. I call upon you as witness that I have given my share in Khaybar as her dower. So she took the share and sold it for one lakh (of dirhams).\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The version of 'Umar b. al-Khattab added in the beginning of this tradition, and his version is more perfect. He reported the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) as saying: The best marriage is the one that is most easy. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said to the man. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition to the same effect.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: I am afraid this tradition has been added later on, for the matter is otherwise.\n",

They (the Ansar) accepted their superiority over themselves in respect of knowledge, and they followed most of their actions. The people of the Book (i.e. the Jews) used to have intercourse with their women on one side alone (i.e. lying on their backs). This was the most concealing position for (the vagina of) the women. This clan of the Ansar adopted this practice from them. But this tribe of the Quraysh used to uncover their women completely, and seek pleasure with them from in front and behind and laying them on their backs.  \n\n\n\nWhen the muhajirun (the immigrants) came to Medina, a man married a woman of the Ansar. He began to do the same kind of action with her, but she disliked it, and said to him: We were approached on one side (i.e. lying on the back); do it so, otherwise keep away from me. This matter of theirs spread widely, and it reached the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nSo Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur'anic verse: \"Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will,\" i.e. from in front, from behind or lying on the back.

I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah.  \n\n\n\nOne day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)?  \n\n\n\nI said: Yes.  He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.  \n\n\n\nA man said: Messenger of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful).  \n\n\n\nHe then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word \"here\". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic.  \n\n\n\nThe agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of Allah?  \n\n\n\nThey replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) so that he could see her and listen to her.  \n\n\n\nShe said: Messenger of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.  \n\n\n\nAbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.  \n\n\n\nThe narrator, Musa, said: Hammad narrated this tradition from al-Jarir from AbuNadrah from at-Tufawi.\n",

He stayed there in a place. People went to the tyrant and informed him saying \u201cA man has come down here; he has a most beautiful woman with him.\u201d So he sent for him (Abraham) and asked about her. He said she is my sister. When he returned to her, he said \u201che asked me about you and I informed him that you were my sister. Today there is no believer except me and you. You are my sister in the Book of Allaah (i.e., sister in faith). So do not belie me before him.

So I made my wife like my mother's back to me till the end of Ramadan. But one night when she was waiting upon me, something of her was revealed. Suddenly I jumped upon her. When the morning came I went to my people and informed them about this matter.  \n\n\n\nI said: Go along with me to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nThey said: No, by Allah.

Hilal said \u201cI swear by Allah I spoke the truth against her.\u201d She said \u201cHe told a lie.\u201d The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) said \u201cApply the method of invoking curses on one another.

Allah will not punish me for this (act), as He did not cause me to be flogged for this (act).\u201d So he bore witness a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on him if he was of those who tell a lie.  Then the people said to her, Testify. So she gave testimony before Allaah that he was a liar. When she was going to testify the fifth time she was told \u201cFear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world. This is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to you.\u201d She hesitated for a moment. And then said \u201cBy Allah, I will not disgrace my people.\u201d So she testified a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on her if he spoke the truth.  Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) separated them from each other and decided that the child will not be attributed to its father. Neither she nor her child will be accused of adultery. He who accuses her or her child will be liable to punishment. He also decided that there will be no dwelling and maintenance for her (from the husband) as they were separated without divorce and death. He then said \u201cIf she gives birth to a child with reddish hair, light buttocks, wide belly and light shins he will be the child of Hilal. If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks he will be the child of the one who was accused of adultery. She gave birth to a child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) said \u201cHad there been no oaths, I would have dealt with her severely.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Ikrimah said \u201cLater on he became the chief of the tribe of Mudar. He was not attributed to his father.\u201d\n\n",

Another kind of marriage was that a man asked his wife when she became pure from menstruation to send fro so and so and have sexual intercourse with him. Her husband kept himself aloof and did not have intercourse with her till It became apparent that she was pregnant from the man who had intercourse with her. When it was manifest that she was pregnant, her husband approached her if he liked. This marriage was called istibda\u2019(to utilize man for intercourse for a noble birth). A third kind of marriage was that a group of people less than ten in number entered upon a woman and had intercourse with her. When she conceived gave birth to a child and a number of days passed after her delivery, she sent for them. No one of them could refuse to attend and they gathered before her. She said to them \u201cYou have realized your affair. I have now given birth to a child. And this is your son.  O so and so. She called the name of anyone of them she liked and the child was attributed to him. A fourth kind of marriage was that many people gathered together and entered upon a woman who did not prevent anyone who came to her. They were prostitutes. They hoisted flags at their doors which served as a sign for the one who intended to enter upon them. When she became pregnant and delivered the child , they got together before her and called for the experts of tracing relationship from physical features. They attributed the child to whom they considered and it was given to him. The child was called his son and he could not deny.

When the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) appointed a Commander over an Army or a detachment, he instructed him to fear Allaah himself and consider the welfare of the Muslims who were with him. He then said \u201cWhen you meet the polytheists who are your enemy, summon them tone of three things and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and refrain from them. Summon them to Islam and if they agree, accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to leave their territory and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants and tell them that if they do so, they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants, but if they refuse and choose their own abode, tell them that they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims subject to Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand jizyah (poll tax) from them, if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. But if they refuse, seek Alaah\u2019s help and fight with them. When you invade the fortress and they (its people) offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction, do not grant this, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction regarding them. But let them capitulate and have the matter refereed to your jurisdiction and make a decision about them later on as you wish.\n\n\n\nSufyan (bin \u2018Uyainah) said thah \u2018Alqamah said \u201cI mentioned this tradition to Muqatil bin Habban, He said \u201cMuslim narrated it to me.\u201d Abu Dawud said \u201cHe is Ibn Haidam narrated from Al Nu\u2019man in Muqqarin from the Prophet (\ufdfa) like the tradition of Sulaiman bin Buraidah.\n",

Four of them stood and came to me. They ascended a mountain. Then they came near me till they could hear my voice. I told them \u201cDo you know me?\u201d  They said \u201cWho are you? I replied \u201cI am Ibn Al \u2018Akwa. By Him Who honored the face of Muhammad (\ufdfa) if any man of you pursues he cannot catch me and if I pursue him, I will not miss him.

He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza\u2019I came, and \u2018Urwah bin Mas\u2019ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (\ufdfa). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (\ufdfa), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu\u2019bah was standing beside the Prophet (\ufdfa).He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his (\u2018Urwah\u2019s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. \u2018Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu\u2019bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu\u2019bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had someone (i.e. some kinsfolk). When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal escaped and joined Abu Basir till a band of them collected.",

When Allah's name is mentioned you may eat what is killed by anything which causes the blood to flow except tooth and claw. I shall tell you about it. The tooth is a bone, and the claw is the knife of Abyssinians. Some people hastened and went forward, they made haste and got booty, while the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was in the rear and they setup cooking pots. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) passed by over the cooking pots. He ordered to turn them over. He then divided (the spoils of war) between them, and gave them a camel for ten goats in equation. One of the camels of the people ran away, and they had no horses with them at that time. A man shot an arrow at it, and Allah prevented it from escaping.

When I entered upon him, he said: Malik, some people of you tribe gradually came here, and I have ordered to give them something, so distribute it among them. I said: If you assigned this (work) to some other person, (it would be better). He said: Take it. Then Yarfa' came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, will you permit 'Uthman b. 'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said:  Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things\". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes.  He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition.\n",

We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women.  \n\n\n\nWhen this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nWhen this news reached the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (\ufdfa), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh.  \n\n\n\nThe infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (\ufdfa), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty.  \n\n\n\nThey sent a message to the Prophet (\ufdfa): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story.  \n\n\n\nWhen the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them.  \n\n\n\nHe told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day.  \n\n\n\nNext he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it.  \n\n\n\nHe turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion.  \n\n\n\nHe (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry.\" He said: \"Without fighting.\" So the Prophet (\ufdfa) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two.

            "hadith_english": "\n\n\nI met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)?  \n\n\n\nHe said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (\ufdfa) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him.  \n\n\n\nA man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants.  \n\n\n\nWhen he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission.  \n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (\ufdfa) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way.  \n\n\n\nAll of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground?  \n\n\n\nI replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so.  \n\n\n\nHe then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was sitting there. I greeted him.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Nothing remains now.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?  \n\n\n\nI said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) passed the night in the mosque.  \n\n\n\nHe then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?  \n\n\n\nI replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me.\n",

Suddenly I saw a man, who had a thin garment on riding his small mule. He had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun.  I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas ibn Malik. \n\n\n\nWhen the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there was no obstruction between me and him. He stood near his head, and uttered four takbirs (Allah is Most Great). He neither lengthened the prayer nor hurried it. He then went to sit down. They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down.  \n\n\n\nAl-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman?  \n\n\n\nHe replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Messenger of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam.  \n\n\n\nA man from among the companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: I make a vow to myself that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword) that day, I shall behead him. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).  \n\n\n\nWhen he saw the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), he said: Messenger of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) for his murder. He was afraid of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) to kill him. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance.  The man said: Messenger of Allah, what about my vow?  He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Messenger of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal.  \n\n\n\nAbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the people.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The saying of the Prophet (\ufdfa) \"I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: There is no god bu Allah\" abrogated this tradition of fulfilling the vow by his remark: \"I have repented\".\n",

The Prophet (\ufdfa) was riding on a donkey with a blanket on him. He said: Muhammad, why do you arrest me and capture the one (i.e. the she-camel) which goes ahead of the pilgrims. He replied: We are arresting you on account of the crime committed by your allies Thaqid. Thaqif captivated two persons from among the Companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa). He said (whatever he said) I am a Muslim, or he said: I have embraced Islam. When the Prophet (\ufdfa) went ahead, he called him: O Muhammed, O Muhammed. Abu Dawud said: I learnt it from the version of the narrator Muhammad b. 'Isa. The Prophet (\ufdfa) was compassionate and kind hearted. So he returned to him, and asked: What is the matter with you ? He replied: I am a Muslim. He said: Had you said it when the matter was in your hand, you would have succeeded completely. Abu Dawud said: I then returned to the version of the narrator Sulaiman (b. Harb). He said: Muhammad, I am hungry, so feed me. I am thirsty, so give me water. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: This is your need, or he said: This is his need (the narrator is doubtful). Later on the man was taken back (by Thaqif) as a ransom for the two men (of the Companions of the Prophet). The Prophet (\ufdfa) retained 'Adba for his journey. The narrator said: The polytheists raided the pasturing animals of Medina and they took away 'Adba. When they took away 'Adba, they also captivated a Muslim woman. They used to leave their camels in the fields for rest at night. One night they slept and the (Muslim) woman stood up. Any camel on which she put her hand brayed until she came to 'Adba. She came to a she-camel which was docile and experienced. She then rode on her and vowed to Allah that if He saved her, she would sacrifice it. When she came to Medina, the people recognized the she-camel of the Prophet (\ufdfa). The Prophet (\ufdfa) was then informed about it and he sent for her. She was brought to him and she informed him about her vow. He said: It is a bad return that you have given it. Allah has not saved you, on its (back) that you now sacrifice it. A vow to do an act of disobedience must not be fulfilled, or to do something over which one has no control.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This woman was the wife of Abu Dharr.\n",
